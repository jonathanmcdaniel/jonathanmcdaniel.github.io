## Javascript
***
### Resume-API
Resume-API is a tool being developed using Node.js and Express.js to help individuals create beautiful resumes. Through the use of templating, an individual can customize each resume to look different ways and contain different content based on the current need. The API will eventually be paired with a website and mobile app to help make the tool more accessible to everyone.

### JMImageManipulator
A javascript class to manage basic image manipulation in a modularized container. Resizing the dimensions of an image to fit a contraint while maintaining the aspect ratio is the main function of this class. Rotation is also supported for both clockwise and counter-clockwise movements. The class uses the HTML5 canvas to achieve its goals. The class creates and destroys the canvas as needed so that no additional work or cleanup is required by the developer.

### JS-ModalAlert
Alternative to the standard JavaScript alert method. I created this as a first project to learning JS. It's not that great but it was my first attempt to getting into more practical web development so I leave it here for nostalgia.

## CSS
***
### Responsive
_Responsive_ is my answer to feeling creatively restricted by Bootstrap. I often find myself using Bootstrap in its entirety when all that I want is the ability to create a responsive design. Bootstrap does this well but also comes with a lot of other styles that encourage me to design my sites a certain way.

### GameOfWar
This repository is being created as a personal challenge to get an introduction to as many programming languages as possible. The reason for doing this challenge by creating a game is that War is difficult enough to require extensive learning, but not so difficult that implemetation of the algorithms will be difficult. Creating the game should give me enough experience in each language to be able to pick it up at any time and be able to work on it, even without having mastered the language.

### Tinkering
This repo is used as a "catch-all" for small things I want to experiment with that aren't large enough for their own project.
